* `dashscope` library
* An Alibaba Cloud account with access to DashScope and an API key.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

## Project Structure

* `main.py`: The entry point of the application, responsible for setting up the QApplication and launching the main GUI window. It also configures basic logging.
* `gui.py`: Contains the `ChatGUI` class, which defines the main window, UI elements, and handles user interactions, chat display, settings, and history management.
* `controller.py`: Manages the interaction with the DashScope API. It includes the `Controller` class with a static method `process_api_request` for sending messages to the AI models and handling responses.
* `assets/`: Directory for static assets such as icons (`logo.ico`, `user.ico`, `robot.ico`, `delete.png`) and stylesheets (`dark_mode.qss`, `light_mode.qss`, `dark_mode_history.css`, `light_mode_history.css`).
* `history/`: Directory where chat history HTML files are stored.

## Logging

The application uses the `logging` module to record informational messages, warnings, and errors to the console. This is helpful for debugging and tracking the application's behavior.

## Future Enhancements

* Export chat history to various formats (e.g., PDF, TXT).
* Search functionality for chat history.
* More advanced settings for model parameters (e.g., temperature, top_p).
* Support for streaming responses from the API.
